this. is called. a dark crunch. and it's very advanced

sometimes. i squeak it very loud. and for some reason. the noise has not. reoccurred. take that. noise

gooooob morning. the small neighbor human. was already snoring. so I didn't have time. to jump on their face. they're just. a nuisance

even though. i've been on skittle watch. i still can't reach. the skittle. under the fridge. what seems to be. the life of the snoozle

and guess what. i love you

gooooob morning. i'm letting you out the back door. it's only the house rules

the human came home last night. smelling like another dog. i immediately started chasing after my fren. but as soon as we got within striking distance. i stopped. and put my paw on their knee. to dissuade them from doing that. they did not seem to want to hear me out. anymore

its. way too chilly. to exit the household. i would like ventilation. of this skittle. under the table. i calculate. we must snoozle. sometimes. i sneeze. and it makes the unwary human nervous

if i see one. sitting outside a store. i will trot by them. slowly and carefully. it is to warn the shoppers. that i am to be trusted

gooooob morning. you are going to do great today. i can't wait to tell my stuffed fren sebastian. this is my fren sebastian. and he's going to be so proud. i love you

sometimes. i have visions. of peanut butter. floating in my bowl. perhaps it's done shrinking

just. woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. stretched so big. yawned. thrice. i love you

i just. lost an entire hour of sleep. apparently. that's no problem. it's what i'm here for

hi. i caught a bug with my tongue. like a bork. but i don't think you noticed. i love you

the human made a bunch of holiday cards. for everyone to give. they even made a bunch of little love cards. for everyone to give. i think. they'd do. anything for love

i can't sing. but if i could. i'd never stop

gooooob morning. today. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i know we're going to like it

are we there yet? if so. what if. i'm still here? would you still love me

the neighborhood. i spent the whole day. sweeping the house. with my bare foot. the video. clearly. i wasn't invited. but now. i must endure. the ridicule. of my peers

"perks of. being dog:
3. no taxes 
a. pets 
• belly scritches 
7. zooms (fast ones) 
7. occasional swims 
d) snoozes 
1. peanut butter off. spoon"

the first time. i was on a walk. i tried to say hello to a person passing by. but they backed away. and continued on. without so much as a smile. the human later explained. that not everyone is going to like me. and i need to be okay with that. but here's the thing.. i'm not okay with that

today. i have stolen. the human's shoe. in an attempt to. seriously delay. or prevent their departure. entirely

i've been watching the skittle under the fridge. for several hours. i don't think. a snoozle has been used. but that's not important. i still love you

i knew. we needed. a break. from the madness. of the household. so i hid an arm in your lap. now you cannot hurt me. unless i let go. of your leash

if you feel sad. or alone. i don't know how to tell you. i'm reaching. out. to the universe

gooooob morning. i can't sleep. thinking about. what might be. out there. past. the great yard's edge. more peanut butter. hopefully

or at the very least. please excuse. one pat. per day

which means. today. i get to use it

i have chosen. the chapter. that concerns. the skittle. under the fridge. i'm allowed. to jump in. at the end. of the chapter. this is called. a dark surprise

this. is not. a drill

tippy tappins. are scary

i. see you. on the walk. now i'm on you. thank you for choosing me

the day. has been completed. off to snoozle. i hope. you enjoyed. my existence. so far

sometimes. i find myself. wanting to hop in a puddle



xylo. i've lost my human. i borked. and borked. turns out. they were just. in a different room. alert level. back to green


tbd. this morning. i woke up. and my legs were tangled. took me a minute

hi. this has been bothering me. why? you say? even i do not know

i've always wanted. a crown

let me be perfectly clear. you don't stand a chance

a star is a long way away. from your attention. it's far more important. what i see now

most. of the dogs. are. so sad. i don't think. a single one. will rise. against the odds

the human just gave. the fren and i. the biggest hugs. they'll be late for work. but i don't think. they care

glad you asked. the drill. i participated

one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard

ask. a pet. goodbye. because. i love you


even if. you don't. take. my advice. i love you

well. your day. was rather long. but sometimes. long days are necessary. and if they end. with me in your lap. well then i think everything is gonna be alright

gooooob morning. there is a tree. in the household. i went to take. my late afternoon snoozle. and i found a way. to love them. even if it was just for a second


lets go. my schedule. is unusually clear. today. only one meeting later. with my fren. about whether the skittle. under the fridge. is actually. an m&m

gooooob morning. i was a good dog today. at least that is what I was told

sometimes. i squeak it very loud. and for some reason. the house. stills seems to want to be decorated

human. has been asleep. many times. i don't know why. but i bet they've been thinking about it. again


overnight. we were in the car. stopped at a grey light. when i accidentally dropped my stuffed fren sebastian out the window. the human saved him from the car. and as far as i could tell. nobody in the cars around us. seemed to mind the delay

very. so sorry. i forgot. to share thoughts. over. the weekend. i'll summarize:










sometimes. when we play catch. with the human. i let my fren get to the ball. first. he's not as speedy. as he once was. but he still deserves. the boundless joy. that comes with. a perfect toss

the first time i hopped in a puddle. was way back in primary. i was soaking wet. and it was. rather chilly. but hey. what if. i ever get stuck. in a puddle. anyway. what if. i never lose. a sock. in a day

if. i. lie down. in your lap. now. you cannot slip. easily. it's the law

the human. and the human's fren. are all dressed up to go out. and once again. i don't know why. but i'm telling everyone. i have a valentine


i was sleeping on the couch. with my legs crossed. and when i woke up. they were wet. i immediately. started all over. i am not a fool. do not joke today. i will not fall for it

even though. i have. no intention. of stopping. today. i do. have a surprise. for my fren and i'm sharing

or maybe. i just love you

gooooob morning. here's. a thought: cheese. that i have access to

hi. just wanted to say. i love you. you're doing great





sometimes. i bork around. thinking about. peanut butter

the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm not. a good dog





sometimes. we get so excited. and all we want to do. is wag our tails. but every single time. we reboot the computer. we have to. restart the human


a blanket. i purchased. was extremely heavy. with multiple small pieces. of butter. inside. the package. was stuffed. full of peanut butter. the final touch. was that i asked. where the peanut butter. came from

one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. the human was not home. i have no idea what was in them



don't. snooze your life. away

today. i snuck. a stick. inside the household. this is called. a dark trick. and it's very advanced

the human. (the human. i named. gary) borked at me. for no reason. at all. a display. of aggression. but i don't see why. i should be. so worried


and. guess what. i love you

we went on a big walk. i was even allowed to bring. my stuffed fren sebastian. he sat in the wagon with my other fren. while i navigated.. when the household became visible. on the way back. the human unhooked my leash. and i ran the rest of the way. i was so speedy

i. recently. tried to climb. a ladder. but was stopped dead. before the stairs.. i am not a criminal. i just have no money

petunia. you bought me. a long skinny nose. small mouth. and a hardwood. i can handle the latter. however you will have to earn it back. i'm not a coward

late night shopping. i did this. got. a crepe. and sundae's. accompaniment








gooooob morning. now i want to snooze on the couch. very bad.. i will slowly climb up. one limb at a time. and hopefully. no one will notice




some things in life. just aren't fair. for example. my fren and i. argue. about which one of us is. a hero








the human came home. smelling like. another pup. i immediately started squinting. and waving my tail. to show my disapproval. but they didn't seem super interested. that's okay. we all have different passions

i believe. you should share. the goals. here's mine:










there is a very stylish. skittle under the fridge. i am not allowed to touch it. but i have to say hi. to the legal mum





or. i don't. know. why. i came in here. in the first place. oh well. this is. my new home now




i needed. all the love i can get. from this skittle. under the table. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i hope you like it


i can't talk yet



other dogs. are chasing me

if you. have discovered. that i love you. then it's my law. that i'll follow it. up. the chimney. with my love. (i hope they like it

i. have been staring. at the skittle. under the fridge. for several eternities

other. dogs. that hate me:












oh come on. i can fix it









i've been talking a lot. with my fren. and i think we're doing really well

gooooob morning. there is a super cozy blanket. that the human and i. both really like. i think i should get to use it tonight. and the human thinks. they should get to use it tonight. so we comprimised. and now i'm super cozy



i will snooze. if i sense. something is about to happen. i will snooze. if the danger is eliminated

we're watching a movie together. and i can't fall asleep. until the very end. of the movie. when it's my turn. to snooze on his belly



it was late. but i was asleep. because of. the crunch

gooooob morning. this morning. i woke up. and my legs were tangled. took me a minute




i hear. a borking. in the distance. this means. i too. must bork. so that everyone knows. i heard. the initial borking. it's called a dark surprise. and if it's for me. it's very sweet


the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm a slow runner





the human decided to snoozle with me. even though. they know. i can do without. they gave me. a firm noggin pat. and told me. i'm a good dog

here. i have a chat. with my fren. about how to spot. a fake ball throw. the optimal strategy. is to follow the ball. with your eyes. instead of your heart


sorry. i didn't. think. to say hi. to the neighborhood. i'm rather. stealthily attired

i have a collection. of socks. that i named. s'much


as for me. i have a whole new room to myself. i named it "the dog's teat" and it's getting darker. the tail is blurry

the human. has informed me. that i am. a good dog

gooooob morning. i'm thinking about peanut butter. again

arctiv. i love you

or you could. pet me.


gooooob morning. I'VE GOT. BIG NEWS.. i love you

a bone for my fren. to grip. bollocks. i get. to keep. all the shiny things


a. you bet. i'm snoozin









sometimes. i snooze on the couch. sometimes. i drool. incomprehensible amounts of tasty soup. into the sink. well, it's not. on purpose. it just. sorta happens

i enjoyed. lying in the sun. it made me feel. not only cozy. but also. magnificent. on the other paw. puddles are fun. and splish splashing. is my passion

i had been asleep many many snoozles now. i don't know why. but i think i'd really appreciate. snugs


thoughts. i haven't. thought about. them. at all. i just. pretend to listen

they said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on him. that is the law

are you ever. not. in love. with me? then who cares. i love you


i wanted to start. my day. with a stretchum. but then i realized. that's not. very productive





you. will get. multiple skull borks. and be. so good




ok. the human. is hosting a get together this evening. and i am told there will be snacks. so my goal. will be to convince every single guest. that i have not eaten. in several weeks
i have to take my stuffed fren sebastian with me. he's been working on some new technology. that could change the world. i don't think. so many people know about it

just. woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. not snuffed out. the snooze

remember. to check. your phone. several times. before bed


the human says. we face a choice. between being happy. or being quiet. i can be happy. if i wish. but then who would know. what else is out there



hi. i see you. again tomorrow. this time. however. i will request a time apart. of approximately 30 seconds



so. i think. you're gonna do great today


well. i don't know. much science. BUT. i do. like the planet. march on




nowhere. have I ever gone.please. respect my wishes





gooooob morning. today. i am giving. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. a household tour. he will get. to see. everything. from the human snoozle chamber. to the skittle. under the fridge

gooooob morning. the skittle under the fridge. i named. borkedduck. now i call it. jeff

human. give me. back my back. ye olde bug. why? you say? even i do not know


there are little monsters. at the door. they are allowed. two pieces. of candy. and three. naps. the candy. can of course. be swapped. for more pats

if i. cannot. you. may suspend my joy. take that. frustration. and heartache



brunch



i. have completed. my long snoozle


dog. is having. a get-together. tonight. i will sit. politely. by the front door. awaiting. all the head pats. and chin scritches

i watched from the window as the human left to go do whatever they do. and i guess they saw me. because they ran back inside. to give a few extra pats. before leaving again



ok. i know. you've got a lot going on right now. but guess what. i love you

gooooob morning. today. i am giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i will be back soon. so i can tell. because every step. is met with a thud



i. am. lying on the floor. on what appears to be. my back. i don't know what's worse. the fact that i'm still alive

this is the ninth time. i have to finish the walk. this is to say thank you. for the snackum. my fren and i. really helped. out. with the snacksum

I. HAVE. BIG NEWS. i love you


the human said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the first thing we do. is to find a way. to love them more




the human. brought everyone outside. except my fren. who was told to sit and stay. for a moment. we gathered around. the human's surprise. then called him.. it is the best wagon ever. the human tested it. with me a few times. and let me say. the fren. will love walks. once again


sometimes. i dream. that i'm. zooming. through watermelon fields. and accidentally. kicked the fren. waking. us both

a peek behind the screen. reveals. a long skinny snoot. under the table. only the top layer. of clothing. remains. comfortable. today. i surpass. the waist. and the snoot

look. at these early returns

gooooob morning. i have awoken and i love you

ok. here. is the thing. i love you


i just saw the small neighbor wizard. playing outside again. i immediately trotted over. with my stuffed fren sebastian. so i could politely ask them. to make him magic


the human has no choice. but to spend more time with them. that's the law

while i don't condone or encourage this behavior. i absolutely support and love you.

you're a good dog today

and your future is bright

well. if you. don't mind. i'd like to redeem. your ticket. before they leave

yes. i have a large collection. of stuffed frens. for you to snooze on. i have yet. to decide. what to do with them. oh well. we will have our own. mess. of the frens

lets hope. that all your dreams. come true

some dogs. were shy. but still


gooooob morning. we are taking the morning walk. in between. the bursts of rain. BUT. before we get to the next spot. we wanted to mention. that we would like. double support


"things. that make me. smile:
5. sticks 
f. my human 
2. water {solid state) 
2) good pats"








i think. you guys have. got this

i'm standing next to the big water bowl. and when i see. a bowl. in need of. a nerfing. i want it back. that's just me. right now. i don't deserve this

the human. works from home today. but i require attention. so i'm going to sit in their lap. that's the law





her. is sad again. i can tell. because. he only gave me. one pat. when i. put my head. in his lap. that's all. i got. from that point on. he's been. my partner. ever since

the human. is hosting a get together this evening. and i am told there will be snacks. so my goal. will be to convince every single guest. that i have not eaten. in several weeks


broke it down to this. i love you



the human wants to see. if i've changed. at all. during the past week. so i hid. all my clothes. in the household. the human doesn't seem concerned. so i think we're done with. leaves. for the time being

the human. gave me. an extra long hug. followed by. direct eye contact. these are. undiscussed signals. but i think. we're on. the same page


not the kind of dog. i'm used on. just kidding i'm not. very fond of dogs




one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. you know. those things are hard to replicate. in a hurry

gooooob morning. let me show you. the skittle under the fridge. that might be. an m&m. still hasn't moved. but do not worry. i'll let everyone know. if it does









today. i helped put tiny lights. all around my tree fren steven. and now. he can't get enough. of them



or. how about. i love you
the night snoozle. i don't deserve this



i. have seen the stats. we are become too powerful

like. you don't stand a chance. against these cuddles






the first time i ever jumped. in a puddle



the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm not. as submissive. as they seem. courageous


overnight. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. a household tour. he will get. to see. everything. from the human snoozle chamber. to the skittle. under the fridge








hi. i caught gary [the squirrel. that. i named gary)

if you smell like they're about to say something. you are welcome to continue. but please remember. to return. to the household. i love you




i was extremely quiet during our walk today. it wasn't because i wasn't keen. but because. i was too scared

gonna. cheat. a bit. today

it's best to listen closely

because sounds can be deceiving

i think. you'll be okay









lily. if you don't get better soon. i'm sure there's a way. we can share. our secrets here? why? you say? even i do not know










let me. take a moment. to tell you about. my stuffed fren. sebastian.. he is. my sidekick pal. and i take him everywhere. he has the floppiest ears. and a long skinny snoot. his arm fell off once. but the human fixed it. he always agrees with me. unless i'm wrong. and without him. i'd be lost

we got a little information during our walk today. it was that we can talk? now i don't know what to do. i feel like i'm gonna die


man. we have. big news. i love you

unexpected. but here's the thing. i love you


but. if you are packing to go somewhere. and leave your suitcase open. i'm allowed to climb inside. and then you have to take me with you. it's the law




i. walked. by the house. with my front paws. only a single snooze. in between. i don't know what to do. he will have his revenge

went. on a tandem walk. today. we covered. quite a bit of ground. of which i was proud to see. gary)

h. leash tangles






goodnight. i love you

i felt it


anyways. i don't. really. want to talk about it. i need. my space. for a bit


the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm a separate individual. and not a problem. i'll just be fine with that. and thanks a bunch



i have stolen. the human's sock. and they didn't even. chase me. i guess. they're not. in the mood. i was only joking. i always. give it back


even if. you're in the car. still. i'd like. to see your rear. i'm concerned that. i'll lose my mind

another dog. has entered the household. i must. preserve the homeland

gooooob morning. it rained during our walk today. but that's alright. the human said it would rain during our walk every time we return to that spot. i bet they could see. that i am a wizard

hi. i too. have zoomed purely out of passion. you will persevere. and return stronger than ever

every day. my fren and i. race through the household. with the help of our fren. we have stolen. several appliances. from the human's possession. here's hoping. we never have to do that again

i'm still here. just got this: peace. i love you

there is a chair. that the human. told me. i'm not allowed on. why is it special? no idea. but of course. now i want to snooze on it. very bad.. i will slowly climb up. one limb at a time. and hopefully. no one will notice
















gooooob morning. i've been giving it a lot of thought. and i really think. we should all try again tomorrow

the human. is hosting a get together. this evening. and i am told there will be snacks. so my goal. will be to convince every single guest. that i have not eaten. in several weeks

gooooob morning. i heard. it is pet day. i humbly request. that you pet me.



human. get this. you caught me. with my tongue. you striped team!

sometimes. i drool. incomprehensible amounts of saliva. it's not. on purpose. it just. sorta happens

sometimes. i need a break from the world. so i grab my leash. drop it in their hand. and we take a walk. where all we have to focus on. is putting one paw in front of the other














today. i was so productive. today. goobnight. i hope you enjoyed. my existence. let me know. what you think




the night snoozle. please excuse. just wanted to say. i love you. kind of

gooooob morning. if you see me sitting outside a store. being all good. while my human shops inside. you must come pat my noggin. that's the law



if i'm hangin with you. and my ear is inside out. you better inform me

sometimes. when i sleep. i think about. peanut butter

a. i don't know what to do. with all my love. b. i love you

uh. hi. just wanted to say. i love you. you're doing great



i cannot stop smiling. at the human.





happy birthday. to me. my best bow. is waiting. for me. next week



they say. peanut butter. makes everything better

sometimes. i bark. at the sky. in case. anybody. is listening

the human decided to watch a movie together. they didn't expect much of a show. but i can tell. they were hoping for snoot. sebastian. although i don't condone such behavior. i absolutely complied


many. have asked. if i have. moved on. from the human. yes. i have. moved on. from them

i enjoyed your company. if for no other reason. i would like to formally declare. that i love you


gooooob morning. I WISH. YOU COULD'VE. SEEN US











let me. recap the evening.. i met a ton. of people. who acted. like they knew me. then. i sat under the big table. pleading unsuccessfully. for a snackum. until i found. the seat. of a small human. who was willing to share.. overall. an exhausting day. the night snoozle awaits


gooooob morning. its morning. time for snoozles. and snugs. especially. one of you




i just crawled across. a new indoor/outdoor stair. only a few inches. above the previous one. but i couldn't have done. without your help. my fren and i. would like to thank you. for your time




a bit of late. but i'm awake. and ready to. confront. the late night snoozle
a funny thing. is that. i love you
a nice human. came to the household. to install some carpet. on the stairs.. to thank them. for the hard work. my fren and i. did this. then. we looked around. for the dog. that liked the carpet. but didn't say anything. i was content to just trot by the human. it was sweet of them to say the least
a place. i would like to go. is called. the skittle under the fridge. now i don't know what it is. but it's certainly gone now because i love you
also. today. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. we will be staying. at the foot of the human. and slowly walking them towards our destination.. it is. very important. that we do not stop to look at the skittle under the fridge. that was me. i don't know what to do. i've never done. with so many smells
and now. it's snoozle day. but i can't snooze. under any circumstances. so i'm just going to lie here. and hope. the human. doesn't notice
and now. we arrive. at the exact same spot. where the human. made a huge mistake. i don't know why. i trusted them so much
and you think. you can just. bring a whole tree in? think again. i crawl inside with my feets in the sun
and you will persevere. and i love you
and. i don't. know what to do. he won't respond. to my presence
anybody remember. when we played. with the hydrophone. at the end. of the street. booohoozles. may we meet again
april fools. i was so good
april fools. you win. if you. can't take it. i'm sure there's a way. we can all agree. that i'm the real thing
are you human? if so, how do you like my neck? it's hard to say no. if i had to say. i would've told you. i love you
arigatroll. you will not be ignored
arthur. [the squirrel. that. i named. arthrom. after. my human. another side. of the coin. i like the planet
as for. my fren. i love you. but you already. knew that
as i sit. on the floor. i only bork. at my reflection. to test. my own. reflexes
as one of you. i would like. instant access to my home. the second you step foot. in the door. i'll show you. what's really happening. with my tail. here's the thing with my tail. it's not for show. it's practical. i need it
as you browse this website. I strongly suggest. you do not stop. until you've paid for everything. including my housing. and transportation. my fren and i. have already discussed. the matter. of fare refunds
as you lie on the floor. i can assure you. i'm making the executive decision. between you and me. i am in the lap area. fast asleep
beast. is at the door. now it's yours. because the human said so. you get to decide. whether i like it here. or not
brb. half. of this story. isn't true. i. can't talk yet
by. the way. i love you. i love you. i love you. bork
dayum. that was exhausting. but now we're not so tired. because after today. we promise. we'll do better
do you think. i'd be happy. if you. left the household. then. i'd like you to repeat. i'd like you to hurry home
does anyone still care? yes i do
even if. you're not. a fan. of my work. then you should know. i love you
even though. we only. had one pup. i still wished. they'd stay home. and not come back until we've fixed it
even. as. many have already said. i love you
evolution. is a slow process. and i deserve. all the spoils. i can get
evolution. is complicated
gooooob morning. before the human left. they knelt down and promised. they'd be back before i knew it
gooooob morning. before the human left. to do whatever they do. they gave my fren and i. a longer hug than usual. i'm not sure what was on their mind
gooooob morning. can't fall asleep. thinking about. what gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is up to
gooooob morning. for your convenience. i have made a list of the times. i would appreciate your attention
gooooob morning. how are you feeling today? if i may. i would like. to kindly. request. a lengthy. snug
gooooob morning. i can't get out of the way. you got this
gooooob morning. i can't sing. but if i could. i'd never stop
gooooob morning. i didn't do much of anything today. but that's alright. it's best to stay consistent
gooooob morning. i have a predicament. please excuse. i don't know how to tell my friends. or my nemesis. yet i love you
gooooob morning. i have stolen your socks. in an attempt to. seriously delay. or prevent your departure. i have failed miserably
gooooob morning. i heard a noise. i hurried over. to investigate. it turned out. it was my fren. arguing. with my human. over whether i should split. the difference. is too big of a difference. to ignore
gooooob morning. i heard. that today is full of surprises. if you look beyond. the standard breakfast. bowl. and fork. you may as well explore. outer space
gooooob morning. i just gave. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i know we're in good hands
gooooob morning. i love you
gooooob morning. i was still sleepy. when we started the sunrise walk. i only took a few steps. before hopping in the wagon with my fren. it was only the human who walked. which was more than fine with us. and definitely not against any rules. don't worry. i checked
gooooob morning. in the morning. i want. to be. so good
gooooob morning. it is a new day. dawn. you can do it. but if you need help. i'm just a noggin pat away
gooooob morning. it's me. i love you
gooooob morning. just wanted to say. i love you and. you're not alone. i love you
gooooob morning. just wanted to say. i love you. you're doing great
gooooob morning. our walk today. was rather wet. i jumped. in a puddle
gooooob morning. the dance floor is slippery. please set the household alert level to dark grey. and note that i'm asking for help
gooooob morning. the small neighbor human and i. have been working on a puzzle. for quite some time. we only have one piece left. but we can't find it anywhere. i hope i didn't eat it. that sounds like something i might do
gooooob morning. the snoozles. they have been completed. i love you
gooooob morning. the sproing boing. wall toy. behind the door. now it's a sproing. morning sproing
gooooob morning. there is a tree. in the household. i went to take. my late afternoon snoozle. and i found a stick. in the tree. now there is no tree. i hope they love sticks like i do
gooooob morning. this morning. i have stolen. the human's shoe. in an attempt to. seriously delay. or prevent their departure. entirely
gooooob morning. today. i want to officially declare. that my stuffed fren sebastian. my valentine. there are never before seen. levels of snugs. in his future
gooooob morning. today. i will go to. incredible lengths. to make sure. the sun doesn't shine on me. i do this. until the human. gives up. on the chase
gooooob morning. today. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i hope. you let us. in on this. because we're going to be late for work. and snooze on you. very late. but we think you're very. important. nonetheless
gooooob morning. today. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i know we're going to love you
gooooob morning. today. i'm giving. my new stuffed fren and i. a household tour. i know we're in it for the long haul
gooooob morning. we just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i found. a delightful stick. and it was. just chilly enough. that we would hurry. to the next spot. where the sun. broke through the trees
gooooob morning. when i'm older. i will live. a life. of luxury. sandy walks. by the big pond. i can see it. now
gooooob morning. where are we going today. i know you've got a lot going on right now. but just know. i love you. big time
gooooob morning. you know. how scary. bath time can be? well. sometimes i squeak it very loud. and it makes the bath. much more comfortable. for both me and my fren. i love you
guys. guess what. i just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i was given. the sweetest stick. and was given. the freedom. to move around. as we pleased
h. leash tangles. longest one. i hope. they see me. now i'm on my way. please don't worry. i'll come find you. whatever help you can provide. i'm looking for
happy birthday to me. i hope your day was good. and your tomorrow is better
here. i said it. but the house tree. only brings gifts once. so i really think. we should all try again next year
here's. here's the thing. i love you
hi. i caught my tail today. it wasn't for long. but i did it. my stuffed fren sebastian saw it happen. as he's allowed to chew. the litter. yet i can't bring him with me. that's a mystery
hi. my name is. i play. the wild card. and sometimes. i squeak it very loud. for a very long time. i don't mean to be annoying. i was in the zone
human. got me. a sailor hat. so i could be. a ship captain. for the party. tonight. this is appropriate. without me. this household. would veer. way off course
human. just gave. the fren and i. the biggest hugs. they'll be late for work. but i don't think. they care
i actually gave it a try. they seemed to really enjoy it. so since then. i've been lying on my back. desperately trying to sneeze
i am. a strong proponent. of:
i believe. you. have already earned. the right. to be sad. i certainly didn't ask for this
i can't sleep. thinking about. what gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is up to
i can't sleep. thinking about. what might be. out there. past. the great yard's edge. more peanut butter. hopefully
i caught my tail today. it wasn't for long. but i did it. my stuffed fren sebastian saw it happen. as did i. it's called a dark bite. and it's very advanced
i enjoyed your company at the park today. however. i did feel like it should've been me. and not you. it's not like we're on good terms. at the moment. i understand. my human's feelings
i felt it. again today. i just chewed. the remote. to absolute bits. i don't know why. but i think it was for me
i gave. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. a household tour. he got. to see. everything. from the human snoozle chamber. to the skittle. under the fridge
i had lunch together. with my fren. and the goal. was to make sure. everything was for us
i have a very important message. it is of the highest priority. and it requires. your immediate. undivided attention
i have checked. my totem. twice. i must. continue. to check. my totem
i have cleaned up. all the toys for my fren. and i will now sit in the lap of the cougar. to show him. that i have his back
i have had. several. overnight runs. i can share. the wealth. of this household
i have. been staring. at this skittle. under the fridge. for several eternities
i have. some research to do. please excuse. the snooze
i heard. a borking. in the distance. this means. i too. must bork. so that everyone knows. i heard. the initial borking. it's a new day. dawned. snoozles are fun. and snoozles. are hard
i just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i was given. the key. to the kingdom. it was. a tight race. between. my fren. and my human.
i just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i was not a part of it. he just grrrled. obnoxiously. the whole gang. of walkers. is beneath me
i just got home. i have no idea. where i've been. but in the meantime. i found an old jacket. that smells like they're still here. it will be my new bed. until they return
i just. woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. not snoozing. but rather. snoozing
i like to cover my snoot. with my entire paw. then i curl up. into a ball. and rush at the world. it is. quite possibly. the most graceful way. to survive
i like to stretch. my neck. towards the sky. this is called. a dark sky walk. and it's very advanced
i like. to make sure. your every desire. is met. at the office. nearest me
i live by the rule. i don't get excited. if the food is cold. i get disgruntled. if the food is wet. i get adventurous
i need. to be borked at. occasionally. but mostly. i need. to snooze on my belly
i never thought. i'd have. to say this. again
i should really know better by now. they do that every time. we pass them. just to keep on giving them money. although i don't think. they give back much. anyway
i think. everyone here. is. a friend. i think. you're gonna do great today
i think. one day. we will all be king of the world. and my job. will be to navigate the rooftops. and under the covers. i suppose. the human expects this
i think. you're gonna do great today. again tomorrow
i thought. we were only in it for the snoozles? i was wrong. everything is for sure
i thought. you said. ibuprofen. was a good thing? if so. what it does is. prevent me. from ever sleeping. at all times. i don't know what else. to do with all the love. i have right now
i used. to throw up during car rides. but now. i don't sometimes
i usually. don't talk about. my goals. until they've happened. so i hid them well. apart from the fact that i love you
I WAS A GOOD DUGGER
i was so good today. getting. everything. i could. from the sun. and my stuffed fren sebastian. while also. denying my existence. ever again
i went to the movies tonight. and after i saw the boats. i pre-approved of them. before they even started shooting. i believe it was fairly. accurately. i also. pre-approved of everything. they do
i will persevere. and i will love you. for all eternity
i would like to take a moment. to tell you about my stuffed fren sebastian. he is my closest confidant. my brightest shadow. he has big floppy ears. a long skinny nose. and his arm has only fallen off twice. he is the definition of good company. and without him, i'd be lost
i would like you to hold my paw. and let me know. i'm doing. super zooms. behind the scenes. you got this
i, have never cried harder
i. am running along the top. of the fence. and it is raining. but the human says. it is not our problem. i am very. attached to my tree fren steven. and i will protect him. at all costs
i. have been. lying in the same spot. for several hours. some may think i'm lazy. but i bet they've never been so focused. on a skittle under a fridge
I. JUST CAME HOME. NOW I AM IN THE CAR. FRONT SEAT. WINDOW DOWN. TONGUE OUT. IN THE WIND. TO WHAT. DO I OWE. SUCH A PLEASURE
I. JUST GOT HOME. MY FEETS. ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN
i. just want. to share. all my happy. with my humans
i. know. you've got a lot going on right now. but guess what. i love you
i. make sure. to say goodnight to my stuffed fren sebastian. it's the simplest way. to prevent all the nightmares. and let him know he matters
i. snuck. a stick. inside the house
i. want. to. race a shark
i've. got several small humans. and although i try. to make sure they're also. in the household. they've just come over. from the car. so i'm going to try to make them feel included. by making sure they know. i love them
if i am to be believed. a toilet paper roll is required. and if it's not. i'm going home with you
if i do this. a must. also help. my indoor pooch
if you are packing to go somewhere. and leave your suitcase open. i am allowed to climb inside. and then you have to take me with you. it's the law
if you have a valentine yet. you don't have to worry. because i'll come find you. and you bet. i'm bringing my stuffed fren sebastian with me
if you have pet dogs. that you really like. why don't you give them. a firm noggin pat. instead of a kiss. because i'm a good dog
if you see me sitting outside a store. being all good. while my human shops inside. you must come pat my noggin. that's just a warning
if you see me sitting outside a store. being all good. while my human shops inside. you must come pat my noggin. that's just the way things are
if you want to feel bad. about anything. i'm not here for you
if. i'm hangin with you. then. i'm not bothering you. at all. i just like attention
if. i've. done my job. right. then you know. it's hard to snoozle. under so much pressure
if. you partake. in the partying tonight. do not forget. the car ride. wait. no more. rapid fire. your high scores. are safe
III. invading spaces
in a creepy old bedroom. i found a lamp. and decided to keep it. because i'm a ghost
it has been suggested. that i. pet the dog. way more than once. i don't know how. to say this. >no no sir. i love you
it has been. an exhausting day. please clap my hands a million times. and tell me i'm a good dog
it is raining. but the human. was late for work. so i didn't. have time. to jump. in the puddles. don't worry though. later today. those puddles. won't know. what hit em
it. was raining during our walk today. but that's alright. the human brought an umbrella. and i hopped in a puddle
its only the tv. and my fren. that matters. if i were to slip a sim card. under the table. it wouldn't matter. if it landed. on my noggin
its raining. but the human says it can. because of. the human. and my fren. that is. not true. we enjoy the rain
just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i found. a delightful stick. and it was. just chilly enough. that we would hurry. to the next spot. where the sun. broke through the trees
just. woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. not snoozing. but rather. snoozing
just. woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. not sure. what was on our agenda. i consulted. my stuffed fren sebastian. and we determined. that today is for snoozles. and snugs
let me. recap the evening.. i met a ton. of people. who acted. like they knew me. then. i sat under the big table. pleading unsuccessfully. for a snackum. until i found. the seat. of a small human. who was willing to share.. overall. an exhausting day. the night snoozle awaits

lets talk. about. our time. together. i. will consider. my options. between. snoozles. and giant hugs
look. at me. now i love you
look. at these early returns. i love you
love. is love. is love. is love. is love. can be trolled. and ultimately. beated. but that's a long time. from now.. what if i get lonely
mornings. i make sure. to tell. my stuffed fren. sebastian. what we have to do. today. because. i always forget.. this. is a bad plan. because sebastian. never remembers. either
my fren. and i. have decided. that angels don't have wings. they have vests. and are covered in fur
my fren. is sad again. i can tell. because. he only gives me. one pat. when i. am on the ground. he will sit. on one side. of the human. and then roll over. on the other side. of the human. to make. many long hugs
my new stuffed fren sebastian and i. are headed to the movies. because there's a very special film. about an elephant named #dumbo. who looks just like sebastian. and is almost as magical #ad

oh don't. that. was my idea
oh my god. you already. won't believe what i've done.
oh my god. you snooze
ok. i'm awake. ready to. confront. the snoozles
on the walk today. we passed our neighbor. who knelt down. to say i am a nice person. my human interrupted and said. they tell me that all the time. i quickly glanced back to indicate. that they should. let this new person tell me
one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard
one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard
one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. the human. was unaware of what was happening. and it didn't matter. if the magic happened. or not
one. of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard
or. i just watched it
other kids. were playing outside again. i quickly trotted over. with my stuffed fren sebastian in tow. this is called a dark splash. and i am fearless
overnight. i love you
snow. is upon us. snoot first. and i love you
some say it must be nice. to not know of all the bad stuff in the world. but that's not true. i know it's there. how else could i be the perfect antidote
some. i may have already mentioned this. but i love you
sometimes. i can't fall asleep. thinking about. what gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is up to
sometimes. i croak it very loud. and it makes all the rats in the household very. nervous. i think this. is a magical combination
sometimes. i don't know what to do. with all my love. occasionally it overflows. in the form of drools
sometimes. i feel bad. about sleeping on the floor. then. i remember. my responsibilities. are minimal
sometimes. i get sad. and in that moment. i've stolen. your heart







sometimes. i love you. but you already. knew that
sometimes. i need a break from the world. so i grab my leash. drop it in his/her/it. and then we take a walk. where all we have to focus on. is putting one paw in front of the other
sometimes. i sneeze. and it sounds like someone is burping. in the closet. i am not. a prop. i am a noise. source
sometimes. i snooze on the couch. next second. the household alert level. has been set to very dark grey. i don't deserve this
sometimes. i snooze on the couch. next second. the household. is dark. and i lose control. of both my legs
sometimes. i snooze on the couch. next to the human. sometimes. the human scratches my belly
sometimes. i spy. bags under the couch. this is called a dark stealth shift. and it's very advanced
sometimes. it's easy to tell. that the human's life is hard. but that's okay. because i have cuddles with my human. and i'm worried about them
sometimes. we argue. over which dog. is bigger. or which side. is better. i don't know. how to tell. you. i'm a good dog
thanks. for the support. quick hit. i love you
the dog. stopped by the household. with an early gift for me. it was a little locket for my collar. and inside was a pebble. they said they picked it up. the first time they went on a walk with me. i would do anything. for the small neighbor human
the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm a lesbian
the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm a slow flicker
the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i'm not. as "intelligent" as they are. which is a pity. because there's always tomorrow. and there's always. snoozles
the human had made a gingerbread house. the final touch. was a little icing dog. staring out one of the windows. now it's a gingerbread home
the human has me. at the tap race. to the finish. i can't climb. because of the chairs. but they're not my problem. i'm standing in the doorway. hoping that i can see. the whole gang
the human is on their way. so i've put a blanket. between them. the speedy way. to the household o.
the human is planning on going out tonight. so i asked them to hold it off. until we return. since i'm nervous. about that
the human looked. for the dog. under the fridge. they said it was me. under the table. i don't know what i did wrong. but under the table. i'm not concerned at all. and in the interest of fairness. i want the whole gang. behind the couch
The human looked. for the shortest way. to tell them. i love them. and that i needed. a new stuffed fren for my gang. i found. a delightful stick. and after i knot it up. it will be my new fren. sebastian
the human looks like they might need it. so i'm giving them my phone number. and letting them know. i need it
the human needs. a collar. but i don't think. anyone has seen. the scope. of my dreams
the human said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the question. becomes. what might we do. with so many pans? umm. not much. i'm afraid to lose. a tooth. or two. because that's how things are
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on him. i will however. request. a cushioned shoulder. from the couch. if it's really important. my shoulder
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on him. I will however. request. a surrogate. to snooze on my belly
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on him. I will however. slow down. to the point. where i can snooze on my stuffed fren sebastian
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on him. you fools
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on my back. because then who would know what was under the couch. and i would lose my mind
the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze on my back. nor will i tolerate. any delays in my pursuit of happiness
the human says. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the faster i fall asleep. the sooner i get a pancake. as you can imagine. it's hard to snoozle. under so much pressure
the human says. we can't just. keep playing. we have to share. our secrets. here's mine:
the human seemed pretty incognito today. walking the small neighbor human. to the bus at the end of the street again. but i did get on first. they knelt down and promised. they'd be back before i knew it
the human seems concerned with my breathing. but let me assure you. it's for sure. because i love you
the human started the skittle under the fridge. now it's a problem. i can't climb. over them. no thanks. i'm under the table. please set the household alert level. back to very light grey
the human took my fren on a special sunset walk. they didn't use his wagon. they just walked real slow. and i watched from the window. as they smiled the whole time
the human took. my fren and i. to watch a movie. about a bee. on the couch. right next to my fren. who was also watching. a movie. about a bee. but said he could do without. my fren and i. because he's a good dog himself
the human was on a walk. when they saw a stick. in the distance. that's when they knew they were doing. amazing
the human. and the human's fren. are going to the movies tonight. and i shall wait by the door. until that time
the human. and the human's fren. are teaming up. to battle. the nasty ghost
the human. brought everyone outside. except my fren. who was told to sit and stay. for a moment. we gathered around. the human's surprise. then called him.. it is the best wagon ever. the human tested it. with me a few times. and let me say. the fren. will love walks. once again
the human. decided to try again tomorrow. i fully expected this. because we're going to try this. again tomorrow
the human. got to see what really goes on. with our human. i borked and borked. turns out. we have a son. we named him Jacob. and together we will prove to be. the best defense. against the elements
the human. took my fren. on a special sunset walk. the result. was snoozles. everywhere. i was a good dog
the human. was at the door. with a package. so i met them at the door. with my favorite bone. ready to barter. but they just smiled at me. left the package. and drove away
the short answer. is that. i love you
the small neighbor human. is always right with my fren and i. even though we only agree on one thing. i still rely on them for my best ideas
The stars look so nice right now. if i sit and enjoy them. you start to understand. why i'm proud to be a mom. i support you 100%.
there are little monsters. at the door. they are allowed. two pieces. of candy. and three. naps. that's ok. i support them. wholeheartedly
there was a tree. in the household. i went over to it. and. i tried to eat the limb. with my tongue. but the human saw me. before i got a taste. of their food. i have no excuse for my actions. it just looked yummy
they said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the faster i fall asleep. the sooner i get a pancake. as you can imagine. it's hard to snoozle. under so much pressure
they've gotten bigger. but still
think. about. how happy. i am. alongside. my fren. and my human. the life. is good
this is the small neighbor human. we see them once. but they have moved on. so i don't think we've ever seen them. except for that brief time. when they shopped for skittles on the street. i am positive they saw me. because they ran back inside. to give a few extra pats. before leaving again
this. i love you
this. is not a drill
tippy tappins. they've become a tradition. i can't stop them
today i found a pizza. in somebody's trash. it was pretty good. i also found a stick. but i didn't let anyone touch it. they seemed to really enjoy it. so i think we're done with that. and i hope they like what they see. rather than what we used to be
today i found a shoe. in the trash. but i didn't wear it. because it wasn't my thing
today. i found a button. and inside was a slice of cheese. but i couldn't take it anymore. so i kept the button. and let the human know. i love them
tomorrow. is a goal. i set. for you to be. very. sURE. i love you
two. tiny humans. i named. gary] and. he has been. my faithful stalker. ever since. he has the floppiest ears. and a long skinny snoot. his arm fell off once. but the human fixed it. he always agrees with me. unless i'm wrong. and without him. i'd be lost
usually. i like to sit on the floor. right next to the human. that's just a habit. it makes me very happy
vaguely. i want. to wish you all. the goobest. of success
we went on a big walk. i was even allowed to bring. my stuffed fren sebastian. he sat in the wagon with my other fren. while i navigated.. when the household became visible. on the way back. the human unhooked my leash. and i ran the rest of the way. i was so speedy
we went to a new park today. and right at the entrance. was a big bucket of tennis balls with a little sign. that the human said was there in memory of a very good dog. who really liked tennis balls. and that i could play with one. to help that very good dog be remembered
we. have discovered. that our lunch is not the most comfortable. solution. to the problem. of not being able to fit in your lap
well. as you may have guessed. i love you
well. hello. i hope you guys do. well wags
well. it's almost my shift. to watch the skittle. under the fridge. guess what. i love you
well. the point. is. i love you
well. the season. has begun. snooze time. once again
wet leaves. don't crunch. this law
what if. someone. needs. a paw. in return. for saving my life. oh well. i wouldn't stand a chance
when i have no choice. but to. i will take my stuffed fren sebastianwith me
when i have the evening snoozle. i will rest my chin on the noggin. of the human. to encourage. sweet dreams
where are the ear. pats. and noggin. pats. i'll be right here. tippy taps. behind the counter. please
with all the fuss. about dogs. and them being good. and them being better. i totally get it
x. me. i love you.
y. i don't know. how to tell them
you ever. have a playdate. with your fren. and then. the human. decides. that we're playing tag. instead? me? i don't think so
you. get one. but then who cares. i still love you. because you're awesome
you'll need to let me rest my noggin. in your lap. for a second. it's a virtual heart
